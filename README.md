# Python Projects

A collection of basic Python projects developed as a portfolio. This repository showcases my learning journey in programming, from foundational concepts to more advanced topics.

### 1. Guess The Number

This is a simple console-based number guessing game. The player tries to guess a random number chosen by the computer.

* **Concepts Learned:** `random` library, `input()`, `while` loops, `if/elif/else` statements, and `try-except` for error handling.

### 2. Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

* **Concepts Learned:** Creating and calling functions (`def`), handling multiple user inputs, and robust error handling with `try-except` for both invalid input and division by zero.
