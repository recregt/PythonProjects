# Python Projects

A collection of basic Python projects developed as a portfolio. This repository showcases my learning journey in programming, from foundational concepts to more advanced topics.

### 1. Guess The Number

This is a simple console-based number guessing game. The player tries to guess a random number chosen by the computer.

* **Concepts Learned:** `random` library, `input()`, `while` loops, `if/elif/else` statements, and `try-except` for error handling.

### 2. Basic Calculator

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

* **Concepts Learned:** Creating and calling functions (`def`), handling multiple user inputs, and robust error handling with `try-except` for both invalid input and division by zero.

### 3. To-Do List

A console-based application for managing a simple to-do list. Users can add, remove, and view tasks.

* **Concepts Learned:** Using `list` data structures, managing user input within a `while` loop, and advanced list methods like `append()`, `pop()`, and `enumerate()`.

### 4. Basic Contact Book

A simple console-based contact management system. Users can add, view, search for, and remove contacts.

* **Concepts Learned:** Using `dictionaries` to store structured data, combining `lists` and `dictionaries`, and implementing a robust search function that is not case-sensitive.
